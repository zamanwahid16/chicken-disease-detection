# chicken-disease-detection

This project aims to develop a system for detecting diseases in chickens using machine learning techniques. The primary focus of this project is to implement an end-to-end ML project with the concept of Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), deployed in Amazon Web Services and Azure.


### Steps to run the project
1. To setup the environment, command `make setup-environment` in the terminal.
2. To run the training pipeline, run `make run`.
3. To run the training pipeline with dvc, run `run-dvc`.
4. To run the web app, run `make run-app`

### Web App Demo
1. Upload a chicken fecal image and check if the chicken is healthy or possibly has coccidiosis
